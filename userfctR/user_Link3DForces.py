    A 3D link is defined by it's starting point A (on body_A) and the ending
    point B (on body_B).

    The force and torque applied on both body is located on point A.

    Parameters
    ----------
    PxF : numpy.ndarray

        Relative acceleration vector (index starting at 1) between point A and B
        expressed in the inertial frame: AxF[1:4] = [A_x, A_y, A_z]
    OMPxF : numpy.ndarray
        Relative angular acceleration vector (index starting at 1) between point A
        and B expressed in the inertial frame: OMPxF[1:4] = [OMP_x, OMP_y, OMP_z]

    tsim : float
        The current time of the simulation.
    ixF : int
        The ID identifying the computed  3Dlink.

    Returns
    -------
    Swr : numpy.ndarray
        An array of length 7 equal to [0., Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My, Mz].
        F_# are the forces components expressed in inertial frame.
        M_# are the torques components expressed in inertial frame.
