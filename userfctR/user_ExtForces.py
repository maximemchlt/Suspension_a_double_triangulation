    Notes
    -----
    For 1D numpy.ndarray with index starting at 1, the first index (array[0])
    must not be modified. The first index to be filled is array[1].

    For 2D numpy.ndarray with index starting at 1, the first row (mat[0, :]) and
    line (mat[:,0]) must not be modified. The subarray to be filled is mat[1:, 1:].

    -------
    Swr : numpy.ndarray
        An array of length 10 equal to [0., Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My, Mz, dxF].
        F_# are the forces components expressed in inertial frame.
